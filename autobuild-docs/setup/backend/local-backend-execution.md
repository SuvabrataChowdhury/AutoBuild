## Backend Application Execution
> **Note:** This configuration is for VS Code only.

1. Locate [backend launch.json](https://github.com/SuvabrataChowdhury/AutoBuild/blob/launch-json-template/pipeline/.vscode/launch.json.template) and rename it to just `launch.json`.
2. From VS Code `Run and Debug` (keybind SHIFT+CMD+D for Mac) select `AutoBuild: Local` and run the backend service in debug mode.
